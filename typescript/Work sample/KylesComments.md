Hello Apoorva! Hello Jake!

## Extra things I did
I really hope you don't mind that I switched to using TypeScript for this little project. If it's not how you do things over at VS I promise it's not hard to follow my changes. Adding typing to a project just makes everything so much more obvious and clear even to those who don't use it.

I also added eslint with some rules I've used recently. Main differences is always using semi-colons, using double quotes, and using LF endings (some files had CRLF, looks like some of you use Windows, eh?).

## What I didn't do
I didn't do something way out of spec like bring in Redux.

## Something I brought in
Lastly I adopted the use of my favorite module I've encountered in all of my time using React: Styled-Components. I believe Styled-Components does to CSS what JSX does for HTML - it elegantly wipes away the border between JSX and CSS.
