somethingjunk
=============
This is simply my code scratch folder. Most people wouldn't put this in a repo, but sometimes I want to write out junk on one computer and continue it later on another. You're not going to find anything interesting here, but boring junk written in a couple of languages, namely Java, Python in different flavors, and maybe some C++ and C#.

I also contain code from existing open projects. Sorry should the authors find and object to this, but I'm honestly just looking at them and making adjustments.

Update August 2013
Well, I've gotten a good taste of Unix and Linux thanks to my job and my decision to dive into the world of OSX finally. Now I've got a hankering for being one of those kooky Linux, pony-tail types. So I got myself a book or three on Linux, grep, and regex. And just today I got myself a Raspberry Pi v2 and I'm going to be travelling back in time to the 80s and 90s and learn myself some bash. So hello world from my Raspberry Pi directly set to the CLI.
