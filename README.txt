somethingjunk
=============
This is simply my code scratch folder. Most people wouldn't put this in a repo, but sometimes I want to write out junk on one computer and continue it later on another. You're not going to find anything interesting here, but boring junk written in a couple of languages, namely Java, Python in different flavors, and maybe some C++ and C#.

I also contain code from existing open projects. Sorry should the authors fine and object to this, but I'm honestly just looking at them and making adjustments.
